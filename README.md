# Algorithms
***

**In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.**</br>


In this part of the algorithms we implement the algorithms in programing using python. Beacuase in now days python is most popular language.

For practice there are various sites are available:

2. [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/index.htm)
3. [javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/daa-tutorial)
4. [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/dsa)

**In this project I also include the various algorithms**

* Binary Search
* Heap
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Knapsack Problem
* Job Sequencing
