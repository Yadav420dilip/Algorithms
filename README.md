# Algorithms
***

**In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.**</br>


In this part of the algorithms we implement the algorithms in programing using python. Beacuase in now days python is most popular language.

For rough practice there are various sites are available:

1. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/)
2. [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/index.htm)
3. [javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/daa-tutorial)
4. [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/dsa)

**In this project I also include the various algorithms**

* Binary Search
* Heap
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Knapsack Problem
* Job Sequencing
